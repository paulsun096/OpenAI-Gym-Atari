# OpenAI-Gym-Atari
Implementation of OpenAI's Gym in Python.
<div>
  <h2>TestRandomAgent.py</h2>
  <p>
    For Atari 2600 games, load gym environments that end with "-ram". <br> <br>
    Set var test_game to envrionment names that end in "-ram" as such: <pre> test_game = "MsPacman-ram-v0" </pre> <br><br>
    instead of:<pre>test_game = "MsPacman-v0"</pre> <br><br>
    since the Atari gym envrionment's take the action_space and observation_spaces from the "-ram" version of Atari games. <br><br>
